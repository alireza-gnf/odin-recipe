    <h3>Ingredients (serving 2)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 free-range eggs, whites and yolks separated into two bowls</li>
      <li>4 dates (Medjool), deseeded and quartered lengthwise</li>
      <li>14 walnuts halves</li>
      <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>Your favourite choice of bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the walnuts in a dry heavy skillet for a few minutes until their
        colour has darkened a bit and they have a toasty fragrance. Remove and
        set them aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the dates in butter for two minutes. They burn in high heat so be
        careful with the temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the egg whites and cook them for 1-2 minutes. I like the egg whites
        perfectly set while the egg yolks are still runny. That’s the reason I
        suggest separating them so you have better control over your preferred
        consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the egg whites turn firm, add the egg yolks followed by the toasted
        walnuts and fry them together for 2 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Salt to taste and serve it with your favourite bread. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
