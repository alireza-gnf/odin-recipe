    <h2>Nimroo Anjir - Honey-Glazed Figs and Fried Eggs</h2>
    <p>
      Indulge in the delightful harmony of flavours with fried eggs paired with
      figs! This charming breakfast dish combines the comforting simplicity of
      perfectly cooked eggs with the sweet, succulent goodness of fresh figs.
      It's an enjoyable twist that adds a touch of luxury to your morning
      routine or makes for a special brunch treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this recipe, I’m going to show you how to honey-glaze the figs, but if
      your figs are already very ripe and sweet, you can skip it. However,
      honey-glazing enhances their natural sweetness as honey and figs
      complement each other perfectly.

    <h3>Ingredients (serving 2)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 free-range eggs, whites and yolks separated into two bowls</li>
      <li>4 figs, halved lengthwise</li>
      <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
      <li>2 tsp mixed seeds to garnish</li>
      <li>A pinch of cinnamon powder to garnish</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>Your favourite choice of bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a frying pan, melt 1 tbsp of butter over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add the honey and mix it with the melted butter.</li>
      <li>
        Carefully place the fig halves, cut side down, into the melted butter
        and honey. Allow them to cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes, or until the
        cut sides begin to caramelise and turn golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spatula, gently flip the figs over to the other side and
        continue cooking them for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until they are
        soft and caramelized.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the figs are glazed and tender, remove them from the pan and set
        them aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the mixed seeds in a dry heavy skillet for a few minutes until they
        are golden brown and have a toasty fragrance. Remove and set them aside
        for garnishing.
      </li>
      <li>Melt 1 tbsp of butter in the frying pan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Add the egg whites and cook them for 1-2 minutes. I like the egg whites
        perfectly set while the egg yolks are still runny. That’s the reason I
        suggest separating them so you have better control over your preferred
        consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the egg whites turn firm, add the egg yolks followed by the
        caramelised figs and fry them together for 2 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the dish with a pinch of cinnamon and garnish it with the
        toasted seeds. Serve your delicious <em>Nimroo Anjir</em> with your
        favourite bread. Enjoy!
